Project of Raspberry Pi Pico W tracked robot focused on remote steering, detecting and avoiding obstacles based on simple radar which uses servo and ultrasonic distance sensor.


Things to do:
- Modes like 'autonomous drive', 'area scanning'
- Voltage monitoring
- Connection Radar-to-database
- Replace prototype cables 

Done:
- Emergency reset button
- Remote control via requests-done
- 3D printed Body-done but need improvement
- Internal power source on 18650 cells-done
